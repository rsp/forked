	Forked clones your forked version of a github repository
	using conventions from: https://help.github.com/forking/

	Usage: forked USER REPOSITORY [DIRECTORY]
	Clones repository:
		git@github.com:YOU/REPOSITORY.git
	and adds upstream remote:
		git@github.com:USER/REPOSITORY.git
	in directory DIRECTORY if specified or REPOSITORY otherwise.

	You have to fork it on github first using the Fork button on:
		https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY
	and set your github username using:
		git config --global github.user USERNAME
	if it is different than your local login name.
	Your github username that would be used right now is: $me
